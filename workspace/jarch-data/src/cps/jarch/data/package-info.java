/**
 * This layer provides facilities to define event driven data models.<br>
 * General Principles:<br>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>Aggressive Error Checking- improper usage generally results in an Error
 *  	being thrown.</li>
 * 	<li>Not Backward Compatible- JDK5.0 features are used extensively. Minimal work
 *      has been done to interface with older java beans models.</li>
 * 	<li>Minimal Reflection- Unlike JavaBeans, very little reflection is used.</li>
 * </ul>
