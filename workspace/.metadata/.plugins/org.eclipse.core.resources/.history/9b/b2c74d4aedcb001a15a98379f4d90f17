/**
 * <strong>Note that this class is currently unused</strong>, but I think it'll
 * come in handy when implementing several features in the future related to
 * DeltaList.
 *
 * <p>This class manages a mapping between one fixed set of indices (a "snapshot")
 * and a different set of indices that is a revision of that snapshot. Each
 * time the list is changed (due to inserts or deletes), the mapping between
 * these indices can be adjusted.
 *
 * <p>For example, suppose you have the sequence:
 * <code>F, I, L, T, E, R</code>, and you have performed some time-intensive
 * calculation on those elements (such as creating a sorted view of it). In the
 * initial case, the {@link IndexSnapshot} provides a natural function to convert
 * between indices:
 * <code>currentToSnapshot(0) -> 0</code>,
 * <code>currentToSnapshot(5) -> 5</code>.
 *
 * <p>When you change that sequence by removing the 'I' and 'E', the
 * {@link IndexSnapshot} we have the sequence <code>F, L, T, R</code>.
 * The {@link IndexSnapshot} provides more value in this case:
 * <code>currentToSnapshot(0) -> 0</code>,
 * <code>currentToSnapshot(3) -> 5</code>,
 * <code>snapshotToCurrent(0) -> 0</code>,
 * <code>snapshotToCurrent(1) -> -1</code>,
 * <code>snapshotToCurrent(5) -> 3</code>.
 *
 * <p>Similarly you can change the sequence again by adding elements
 * <code>O, A</code> to create the sequence <code>F, L, O, A, T, R</code>.
 * The {@link IndexSnapshot} provides these results:
 * <code>currentToSnapshot(1) -> 2</code>,
 * <code>currentToSnapshot(2) -> 7</code>,
 * <code>currentToSnapshot(3) -> 8</code>,
 * <code>currentToSnapshot(4) -> 3</code>,
 * <code>snapshotToCurrent(1) -> -1</code>,
 * <code>snapshotToCurrent(3) -> 4</code>.
