/**
 * <p>
 * Annotations used to document common "micro patterns" and conditions.
 * They are meant to ease the documentation and comprehension of
 * code as well as standardize very common constructions.
 * Most full fledged "design patterns" are not included since each time one is
 * implemented there are often subtle variations and so they are better documented
 * individually on each use.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * These annotations are not meant to provide a design contract system.
 * They are meant to be part of a unit's contract.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some annotations also help tag constructions so that they can easily be found
 * like {@link Reflect}.
